# steelseries-sonar-api

A python api for steelseries' sonar software. An advanced form of <a href="https://github.com/Mark7888/steelseries-sonar-py">Mark7888's sonar api<a> including the possibility to change audio devices and use a hardware controller to interface with sonar.

## IMPORTANT 
This will ONLY work with streamer (for now) because I use streamer mode.


##Instalation
Create a new folder anywhere you want, it will later be filled with all the files.
1. Download Nirsoft's SoundVolumeView from <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/soundvolumeview-x64.zip)https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/soundvolumeview-x64.zip">here<a> and place it into your folder. It should now look something like this: ![Alt text](soundvolumeview.png)
2. Download this repo and unpack it somewhere else than this folder.

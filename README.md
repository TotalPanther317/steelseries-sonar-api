# steelseries-sonar-api

A python api for steelseries' sonar software. An advanced form of <a href="https://github.com/Mark7888/steelseries-sonar-py">Mark7888's sonar api<a> including the possibility to change audio devices and use a hardware controller to interface with sonar.

# IMPORTANT 
This will ONLY work with streamer (for now) because I use streamer mode.
